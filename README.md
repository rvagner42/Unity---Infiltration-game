# Unity---Infiltration-game

Mini-game of infiltration, realized in one day.

Controls:
- W, A, S, D to move.
- Hold Left Shift while moving to run.
- E to interact with objects when prompted to do so.
- Moving the mouse will change the direction the camera is looking, FPS-style.

The objective is to get the key on the desk, behind the locked door, without being noticed.

The player has a discretion gauge, that goes up when :
- He is running.
- He stays in blue lights.
- He is in the field of view of a camera.

When the gauge reaches 75%, the alarm is declenched, and the player has to remain as discreet as possible.
When the gauge reaches 100%, the player is noticed, the game is lost and automatically restarts.
The gauge goes down gradually when the player isn't loud or visible.
